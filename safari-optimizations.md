# Safari Performance & Compatibility Issues

## Common Safari Problems in Modern Web Apps:

### 1. CSS Issues:
- `backdrop-filter` has poor performance and limited support
- Complex CSS animations cause frame drops
- Multiple box-shadows impact rendering performance
- CSS custom properties with calculations are slow

### 2. JavaScript Issues:
- Web Crypto API has different implementation quirks
- Clipboard API has stricter security requirements
- Event handling differences (especially mouse events)
- Memory management issues with large DOM trees

### 3. Animation Issues:
- CSS transforms on many elements simultaneously
- Keyframe animations with complex properties
- Shimmer/shine effects using gradients

### 4. WebKit-Specific Issues:
- Different behavior with `position: fixed` elements
- Layout thrashing with dynamic content
- Paint invalidation issues with pseudo-elements

## Solutions to Implement:
1. Add Safari-specific CSS optimizations
2. Improve Clipboard API fallbacks
3. Optimize animation performance
4. Add WebKit-specific fixes
5. Reduce DOM complexity for large JSON
